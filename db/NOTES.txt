Thoughts:
- Right now, dir is a constant that we set -> For easier testing, it might be
better to store it in a struct variable instead.
- Polish the write path would be benefitial for future dev process.
- Some thoughts:
-> Implement writing to more than 1 file
-> Then implement the index. Make it a process of: I have this but it's not good
enough, we need something else
