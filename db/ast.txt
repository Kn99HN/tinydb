JSON parsing for bradfield db

A query plan can be generated from JSON. However, parsing from JSON into the
nodes can be difficult from string. Getting fields from struct is difficult 
since it's from string to struct. Maybe, we can define a more structured way
to parse from JSON into nodes.

{
	head: {
		name: PROJECTION
		args: []
		child: {
			name: SELECTION
			args: []
			child: {}
		}
	}
}
